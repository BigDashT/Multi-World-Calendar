# Security and Bug Policy

The only versions of Big-T's Multiworld Calendar and Weather System (BMCWS) that are supported by me are the latest release version from the releases section of this repository. Any other version made by another maintainer or any version made by me that isnt the current release version is unsupported.

Feature requests are welcome but will only be accepted for requests to the newest release. 

Bug Reports that exist in unsupported versions that do not occur in supported versions will be rejected.

Make sure to always check for the latest version in the releases [here](https://github.com/BigDashT/Multi-World-Calendar/releases).

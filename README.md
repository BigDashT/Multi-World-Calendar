# Big-T's Multiworld Calendar and Weather System!
#### Or BMCWS for short!
A Multi-World Calendar and Weather Generator for Roll20

Originaly made by [Kirsty](https://app.roll20.net/users/1165285/kirsty) and [Julexar](https://github.com/Julexar/)

(Note: Mention of the names of original contributors/maintainers/creators does not imply endorsement by the named individuals/entities)

I forked this calendar from the original maintainer (Julexar) because it had been last updated well over a year ago and some features were either not working as expected, missing or buggy so I took it upon myself to fix this and add some new functionality that was very useful to me as a DM!
